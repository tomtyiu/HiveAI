# HiveAI
The HiveMindsAI system consists of a centralized Queen AI that oversees and delegates tasks to multiple subordinate AIs, ensuring tasks are performed until completion.

# Flask AI Orchestration Web App

## Overview
This project is a web application created with Flask that provides dynamic task delegation between a "Queen AI" and multiple "Subordinate AIs". The app allows users to input a task description, determine the complexity of the task (single vs. multi-agent), distribute the task accordingly, and integrate the results before presenting them to the user.

### Core Features:
- **Dynamic AI Task Delegation**: Decides on single or multi-agent task handling based on complexity.
- **Response Integration**: Combines multiple worker outputs into a cohesive result, using Queen AI.
- **Intuitive Web Interface**: Simple, user-friendly form for task submissions.
- **Use of Modular AI Logic**: Functions sourced externally to keep the app scalable and maintainable.
